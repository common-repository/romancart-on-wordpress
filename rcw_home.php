				a Wordpress e-commerce site using RomancCart. The development team is not connected to RomanCart in any way and we will avoid duplication of any existing
				RomanCart services as best as we can. This software encourages the use of RomanCart 
				and has the goal of increasing the ability to use multiple RomanCart accounts on one site among many other advantages. Sales income from the premium edition is intended 
				to cover full time labour costs for support staff available by phone, email, blog, forum. We will also create may online tutorial videos and more. 
				Support for RomanCart operations connected to the use of this plugin with your blog must be sought at BrighterWebs.com. 
				No support should be expected from the RomanCart team as they have no knowledge of how the software operates. "RomanCart on Wordpress" is what the plugin
				does rather than a brand/product name also, the name is not reserve by WebTechGlobal.','','closed');
